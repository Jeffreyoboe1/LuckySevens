# LuckySevens
A browser betting game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This game takes a starting bet from the user.  If the bet is negative or zero, it displays an error.

The game rolls two 6 sided dice.  If the amount is 7, then it adds $4 to your bet.  If it is not seven, it will subtract $1 from your bet.  The program will roll the virtual dice until you are broke.

The program tracks starting bet, total rolls, maximum money earned, and at what roll the max amount occurred.

The program features a Play Again and Reset button.
